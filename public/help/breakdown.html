<p><strong>How is character value calculated?</strong></p>
<p>A character's value is broken down into four components:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>Survival: When under attack, how well will this character survive?</p></li>
  <li><p>Melee: How strong is this character's natural melee attack?</p></li>
  <li><p>Ranged: How strong is this character's ranged attack? Special consideration is given if the character comes with their own intrinsic ranged weapon.</p></li>
  <li><p>Adventure: How well does this character do in the adventure phase?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The total of all of these is the character's value.</p>
<p><strong>Well-balanced</strong> characters have values within 3 points of 500.</p>
