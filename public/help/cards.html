When characters start with cards, their point count <br />
goes up by a fixed amount per card added. Henchmen are <br />
the most expensive cards to begin with, followed by <br />
elite cards, secret cards, and common cards. 

<p>You may start with the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>0 to 4 Henchmen</li>
  <li>0 to 4 Elite cards</li>
  <li>0 to 4 Secret cards</li>
  <li>0 to 4 Common cards</li>
</ul>

<p>There are special standard card bonuses (or anti-bonuses):</p>
<ul>
  <li>No give cards (-15): Character cannot give cards to other characters.</li>
  <li>No trade cards (-30): Character cannot give/get cards and cannot use the vault.</li>
  <li>No limit (+15): Character can exceed the 4-card carry limit.</li>
</ul>
