<h2>Welcome!</h2> 

<p>
This is the Lair of Lith application site, 
where you can generate cards as well as save them 
if you create an account. 
</p>

<p>
Currently we can generate character cards, as well 
as implementing the official algorithms so that you 
can interactively balance your characters. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> We support rendering portraits 
but do not support uploading them. Thus you can always 
choose a portrait to go with a card when you generate 
it, even if you don't own the card---you won't be changing 
the underlying card data itself.

Any feedback, bug reports, and feature requests can be 
made to <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1010922/doa-ii-character-value-calculator-v0-5">this BGG Thread</a>.
